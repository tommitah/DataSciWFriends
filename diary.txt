Learning 'diary' - AI course - Tommi Tahvanainen

This isn't as much a learning diary, since I only found the requirement for a diary
when I was in the latter half of the course. I also have absolutely no idea what a learning diary
is supposed to entail, so here goes. I'll talk a bit about how it was working on this and that'll be that.

Starting off from the intro to data science, I was a bit worried this course wouldn't have a lot
of actual 'AI' content, that is to say machine learning/neural networks and the works. I was glad that
my years spent doing linear algebra at school weren't a complete waste and drawing graphs was good fun.

The part with the videos was a nice change of pace, most of the videos were interesting, well produced
and even entertaining. I had no idea AlphaGo was a thing but I can't say it was a surprise that we
already have an AI that beats the best players in Go.

Chapters 4-6 started challenging my number crunching muscles, since the problems started to be hard
to reason about with simple algebra. Regression was interesting, although I feel like the data sets were
a bit boring, weirdly sanitized and at some point I wished the values for some calculation could've been
checked somewhere. Providing the correct answers helps us learn, since we won't necessarily know if we
went wrong somewhere without them.

By the last two chapters the exercises had started to get a bit repetitive. It was cool to utilize
the scalers, I think this is something that would be really useful in almost any business context.

All in all, not the worst course I've ever done. Points for not using the 'programming exercise' functionality
that is mostly always a pain in the ass, and not conducive to learning in any way.
